1. Dark Mode

Visitors are able to change the background color of the webpages from white to dark, and the text to black. The dark mode button can be located in the navigation menu of each webpage. Inspired by Google's dark mode color, the background color changes to a dark grey color, which ensures good accessibility and contrast is maintained.

2. Alert on Every Submitted Answer (test_yourself.html).

Visitors are able to get feedback on their submitted answers for every question on the test_yourself.html page. A pop up message (alert function) tells the visitor "Answer is correct!" or "Answer is incorrect!" will appear depending on the submitted answer.
