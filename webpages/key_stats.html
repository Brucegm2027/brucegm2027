            <p class="lh-lg">
             Box Plus Minus (BPM) estimates a basketball player's contribution to the team when the player is on the court, per 100 possessions. To calculate BPM, offensive box plus minus (OBPM) and defensive box plus minus (DPBM) are added together. Basic box score data, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks, is used to calculate OPBM, whereas contributions to defense are used for DBPM. A negative BPM signifies that a player is hurting their team's performance, while a positive BPM indicates the opposite. BPM can be good for identifying role players who enhance team performance. Some people characterize these players as "glue guys." As an analogy, a good box plus minus is like a glue that holds the team together. In essence, the purpose of BPM is to measure how much better or worse a team performs when a player is on the court.

             Context is flawed for the BPM metric. Players can have the same BPM, but have different roles on a team. For example, players with higher possession of the ball tend to have higher BPMs, since they accumulate more stats in the box score. This can lead to inefficient scorers having good box plus/minus, simply because they had the ball in their hands more often, creating more offensive opportunities. Additionally, defensive box plus/minus (DPM) is estimated, as several defensive metrics are not included in the basic box score. This flaw can underrate defenders.

            <h2 class="my-4">Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%)</h2>
            <p class="lh-lg"> 
              Effective field goal percentage (eFG%) is a player's field goal percentage, with three-pointers made being worth more than two-pointers made. Specifically, it is calculated as follows: (field goals made +  0.5 * three-pointers made) divided by field goals attempted. This advanced statistic is used to differentiate between three-point shots and two-point shots, as the default field goal percentage (fg%) can be misleading for volume three-point shooters. As an analogy, three-point shots made are weighted heavily on a balanced scale compared to two-point shots made.

            <h2 class="my-4">Usage Rate</h2>
            <p class="lh-lg"> 
              Usage rate measures how often a player ends an offensive possession, either by shooting the ball or turning it over. It is calculated as follows: the total amount of field goal attempts, free throw attempts, and turnovers, divided by the team's total possessions when the player is on the court. A high usage rate means a player is heavily involved in their team's offense. Primary ball handlers and star players typically have a high usage rate, as they play a significant role in the offense. As an analogy, a high usage rate is like a person carrying lots of grocery bags. This person is responsible for delivering the groceries to their desired location. A low usage rate suggests that a player has a more minor role in the offense, such as playing off the ball or taking fewer shots.

              Usage rate does not measure efficiency; it simply indicates how often a player ends a possession. A player can have a high usage rate, but be inefficient (missed shots or turnovers). Usage rate is also an offensive stat, as no defense is recorded in this metric. Therefore, this statistic favors star players who drive the offense; it doesn't do well in measuring the value of defensive or role players.
