                Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has shown tremendous growth as an offensive and defensive player in the NBA. Starting with a negative Offensive Box Plus/Minus of -0.9 as a rookie, his offense has only improved every year. He recently recorded a dominant 8.9 OPBM in his MVP season (2024-2025), highlighting his evolution as one of the league's best scorers. Although his defensive BPM doesn't classify him as an elite defender, it has never reached negative throughout his career. Shai's DBPM scores make him a positive defender on the court, and not a liability. Overall, Shai's BPM scores demonstrate his transformation from a promising young player to a solidified franchise player, largely due to his positive impact on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court.

                Despite a fluctuation of three-pointers attempted throughout his career, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's shooting efficiency has remained consistently high. His three-point percentage and effective field goal percentage reached their peaks in the 2020-2021 season. His efficiency beyond the arc has translated from a field goal percentage of 50.8% to an effective field goal percentage of 57.1%, representing a 6.1% increase, the highest of any season. This jump is due to his highest three-point percentage of his career (41.8%). It should be noted that he played only 35 games that season, which is the fewest in his career. Nevertheless, his MVP 2024-2025 season indicates a positive trend in maintaining his status as an efficient scorer.

                Nikola Jokić's Box Plus/Minus has been dominant throughout the 2020s, making him one of the most impactful players in the modern basketball era. Jokic has led the league in offensive box plus/minus (OPBM) and overall box plus/minus since the 2020-2021 season. Furthermore, his defensive box plus/minus led the league for three consecutive seasons (2021-22 - 2023-24). These records are impressive, considering the average start of his NBA career. The consistency of double-digit box plus/minus metrics is a testament to Jokic's all-around skills on both offense and defense. What started as an unknown prospect from Serbia has turned into an all-time player and consistent MVP candidate.

                Nikola Jokic's effective field goal percentage further reinforces his dominance as an offensive player. He has remained above 60% since the 2020-2021 season. He peaked in the 2022-2023 season, posting an eFG% of 66%. Interestingly, this career high came in the same year when his three-point attempts per game dropped from 3.9 to 2.2, the third lowest of his career.

                It is evident that Giannis Antetokounmpo’s box plus/minus reflected a modest start in terms of being impactful. Negative and league-average bpm scores highlighted his status as a raw prospect in his first three seasons. However, by the 2016-17 season, he began making positive leaps on both offense and defense, jumping from a 2.1 overall BPM to a 7.3 BPM. Since then, all BPM scores have never fallen below scores from his first three seasons. In fact, he peaked in the 2019-20 season, with a BPM of 11.5, which led the league. These scores solidify Giannis as a strong, consistent two-way player in the 2020s.

                This table is a strong indicator that Giannis Antetokounmpo lacks three-point shooting. All three point percentages are below league average, and his effective field goal percentage does not increase noticeably compared to his regular field goal percentage. It's no surprise that his three-point attempts have decreased over time, having peaked at 4.7 attempts per game in the 2019-20 season. Despite this offensive limitation, Antetokounmpo's relentless finishing in two-point shots has maintained a high effective field goal percentage. He peaked in eFG% during the 2023-24 season, despite attempting the 5th fewest three-pointers.
